Deterministic model of kinetics and voltage-dependence of Ih-currents
in layer 5 pyramidal neuron, see Kole et al., 2006. Implemented by
Stefan Hallermann.

Predominantly HCN1 / HCN2

TITLE Ih-current

UNITS {
	(mA) = (milliamp)
	(mV) = (millivolt)
     (mM) = (milli/liter)

}

INDEPENDENT {t FROM 0 TO 1 WITH 1 (ms)}

PARAMETER {
	dt 	   		(ms)
	v 	   		(mV)
        ehd=-45 		(mV) 		       ::::::::::::  Note PG changed this to -45, as this change was made in all sections in Kole exampel		       
	gmax=%Max Conductance Density% (mho/cm2)

FUNCTION alpha(v(mV)) {

	alpha = 0.001*6.43*(v+154.9)/(exp((v+154.9)/11.9)-1)
	: parameters are estimated by direct fitting of HH model to
        : activation time constants and voltage activation curve
        : recorded at 34C

}

	beta = 0.001*193*exp(v/33.1)			
}

DERIVATIVE state {     : exact when v held constant; integrates over dt step
	qq' = (1-qq)*alpha(v) - qq*beta(v)
